I currently use a fork of the program called
[GitHub-Wikifier](https://github.com/supersym/GitHub-Wikifier) for a structured
approach to documentation I host on GitHub. Part of my documentation efforts in
learning, teaching, reading, writing and archiving software will be manual of
nature. Other things I'll want to automate with a tool. Further I'll be wanting
do some literal programming exercises, text and lexical analysis and other
operations to extract meaningful context on the nature of source codes in the
collections that I hold. Regardless of the means I use, any files that serves
as something with a "simple" numeral index system, by naming conventions in the
file name, for now separation of compounds on "." is used - more elaborate
schemes may follow - and optionally inside the file content as 'rich' markup of
code comments.

Indexed Guidelines
==================

First order of guides that I found useful to maintain now or in a later stage
such as general programming conventions and style guides that are used in
freelance work.

+ 010 General software architecture
+ 011 Program design guidelines (applications)
+ 012 Background processes and jobs (daemons)
+ 013 Multi-tier and multi-layered designs
+ 014 Programs as chainable black-boxes (flow)
+ 015 Designing extensible plug-in frameworks
+ 016 Service-oriented architecture for the cloud
+ 017 Traditional client-server model systems
+ 018 Modern day web-design architectures (intro)
+ 019 ...

All guides will be a certain writing style depending on the amount of
information available at the time, the type of information and the best way to
display this with intent of partially automating the knowledge inside these
(data) text files to be easily used for (literate) lexical/parser programs to
deduct logic, symbols, proofs and regular expressions etc.

I decided I will probably use parts of it to try and learn some `Bird-style`
Haskell.
