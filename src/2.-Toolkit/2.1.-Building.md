Build-tools are often included with projects to help co-developers or end-users
quickly build their software packages from source.

The source of a program, in this context, may be code but could just as well be
data, text or code-as-data. Basically these types of tools 'wrap' certain
(external program) functionality that makes them suitable for the kind of
construction logic that is required. Because it's in the same language, because
it suits the platform (Bash on a Linux server makes so much sense, it's in the
shell!)

### Makefile
[example](http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~gibson/classes/181/make.html#make1)

A Makefile is a (text) file with make commands in it. What's a make command? A make command is a make rule that looks like this:

```
lab05b05b: lab05b.cc
           CC -o lab05b lab05b.cc

If I types make lab05b at the command line (assuming I have a file called Makefile in my directory with the above lab05b rule in it), then the line

```sh
CC -o lab05b lab05b.cc
```

will be executed. So why not just type in the CC command yourself? The beauty
of make is that it will execute the CC command only if your lab05b.cc file has
changed! So unlike the script file above (which compiles main.cpp and
drawing.cpp regardless of whether or not the files have been modified), make is
"smart": it only compiles what it needs to.
